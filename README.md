# solid-edge-mechanical-designs

This repository contains mechanical design projects created using Solid Edge.
The work demonstrates 3D modeling, assemblies, constraint-based design,
and engineering documentation.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- Parametric 3D modeling
- Assembly constraints and motion
- Engineering drawings and dimensioning
- Design iteration and attention to detail
